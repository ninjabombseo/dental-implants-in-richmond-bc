Traditional dental implants continue to be excellent choices for replacing missing teeth; however, there are many options for implants. It is important to talk to your dentist about all the options so you can make an informed choice.What are dental implants?Dental implants are the most secure, fully functional and permanent way to replace a tooth. They are mechanical devices designed to be a substitute for a missing tooth. They function as an artificial tooth root which a dental crown, bridge or denture can then be inserted.What does dental implant surgery entail?Thorough oral examination: An important factor in ensuring the long-term success of a dental implant is the bone in which it’s placed. The dental specialist will examine your jaw to determine whether the quantity and quality of bone in the region of the implant is sufficient. The location for the implant will be examined to make sure it is far enough from neighbouring anatomical structures. Finally, the soft tissue and bone tissue will be evaluated to make sure they are pathology free.X-Rays: Your dental professional will take photos or 3D images of your jaws and teeth to determine whether there is sufficient healthy jaw bone. Any deficiencies within your mouth will be identified.Anesthetics: Having an implant placed is a surgical procedure. For that reason, a local anesthetic (and possibly also sedation or a general anesthetic) is used.Identifying the position and placing the implant: Once the bone has been accessed, the dentist will use a series of drills, each of increasing diameter, to prepare a hole into which the dental implant will be placed. At this point, you will have a gap where your tooth is missing. Crowns, bridges or dentures will then be placed in this gap.What are the different types of dental implant surgeries?According to the American Academy of Implant Dentistry, there are two main types of implants:Endosteal Implants: These are made from titanium and shaped like small screws. They are surgically implanted directly into the jawbone. Once the surrounding gum tissue has healed, a second surgery is needed to connect a post to the original implant. Lastly, an artificial tooth (or teeth) are mounted to the posts.Subperiosteal implants:  Subperiosteal implants are placed under the gum, on or above the jawbone. They consist of a metal frame that is fitted onto the jawbone just below the gum tissue. As gums heal, the frame attaches itself to the jawbone.  The posts (which are attached to the frame) will eventually protrude through the gums.If you are missing more than one tooth, speak to one of our dentists at any of our locations, or schedule a dental implant consultation with our dentist and team.

What Specialist is Best for You?When you visit the dentist, you often meet many staff members, each of whom is responsible for one or more aspects of your oral health care. When choosing a dental professional to provide a specific service, however, many patients may not understand the difference between a dentist and an oral surgeon. It is an important distinction that could affect the outcome of your dental procedure.Role of a dentist:Dentists are responsible for maintaining good oral health and are aware of your entire oral health history. What you can expect when visiting the dentist is a thorough cleaning with a dental hygienist, a full dental exam (where they will inspect your teeth, gums and probe between the gum lines looking for decay or deep pockets), scaling (a procedure used to remove extremely stubborn build up), oral cancer screenings, fluoride treatments, x-rays to look for any problems that can’t be seen with the naked eye and sealants (if applicable to your child). If your dentist notices any abnormalities (i.e. gum disease or extremely deep pockets between your teeth and gums) they will refer you to an oral/maxillofacial surgeon who will examine these issues further.Role of an oral surgeon:If your dentist refers you to an oral surgeon, it does not necessarily mean you have a challenging case to treat…it simply means there is a specialized surgeon who can adequately treat your case better than a general practitioner.  Oral and maxillofacial surgeons focus on treating problems related to the hard and soft tissues of the face, mouth, and jaws. You might need oral surgery for something as common as dental implants or for the treatment of a tumours or cysts in your jaw.Here are some reasons why you may need to visit an oral surgeon:Dental Implants: As an alternative to dentures, you would see an oral surgeon if you wanted implants to replace any broken or missing teeth.Impacted teeth: If your teeth are impacted or fully below the gum line, you would need to see an oral surgeon who will administer a general anesthetic who will cut into the jaw line to remove the teeth.Cracked or fractured teeth: If you have teeth that are already cracked or fractured and are likely to break more during the extraction, you would see an oral surgeon who is trained in the delicate procedure of removing cracked or fractured teeth.Complications during extractions:  If your tooth has complex roots or develops cracks, an oral surgeon may be called in to minimize discomfort and the risk for further complications.Sufferers from dental anxiety: Regardless of the physical situation with your tooth, some patients prefer to be asleep for an extraction if they suffer from dental anxiety or a fear of going to the dentist. In this case, an oral surgeon is needed to administer general anesthesia.Getting teeth removed and deciding whether to get a dental implant procedure is a big step. We recommend talking with your dentist first. Your dentist can assess your situation and recommend the oral surgeon or dental specialist that is most suited for you.<br><br><iframe width="65" height="37" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2IAlliQbrRE" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></br><iframe src="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=sk7618ut4gpvf55ki80f3gm5fo%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FChicago" style="border: 0" width="800" height="600" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></br><iframe src="https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRJeuD5MG7SZo_4uqxZFG8uyr3qvtm8YtxW4F19M4NMhx80v3Znyh3kBQq6NM6PImodoomVvKwup4C8/pub?embedded=true"></iframe></br><iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m10!1m8!1m3!1d2608.194154375397!2d-123.1203068!3d49.1779023!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1531424512724" width="600" height="450" frameborder="0" style="border:0" allowfullscreen></iframe></br><iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!4v1531425347461!6m8!1m7!1syRZbxZ-0dQlrNXBQoXWsDA!2m2!1d49.17734292284374!2d-123.1203130748166!3f13.619360992576235!4f6.722188454772763!5f0.7820865974627469" width="600" height="450" frameborder="0" style="border:0" allowfullscreen></iframe><p><a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/dental-implants-in-richmond-bc/Smile-Shapers-Dentist-Richmond-BC.html">Dentist Richmond BC</a><br> <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/dental-implants-in-richmond-bc/Smile-Shapers-Dentist-Richmond-BC.html">Emergency Dentist Richmond BC</a><br> <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/dental-implants-in-richmond-bc/Smile-Shapers-Dentist-Richmond-BC.html">Endodontist in Richmond BC</a><br> <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/dental-implants-in-richmond-bc/Smile-Shapers-Dentist-Richmond-BC.html">Tooth Extraction in Richmond BC</a><br> <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/dental-implants-in-richmond-bc/Smile-Shapers-Dentist-Richmond-BC.html">Smile Shapers Dentist Richmond BC</a><br> <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/dental-implants-in-richmond-bc/Smile-Shapers-Dentist-Richmond-BC.html">Dental Implants Richmond BC</a><br> <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/dental-implants-in-richmond-bc/Smile-Shapers-Dentist-Richmond-BC.html">Root Canal Richmond BC</a><br> <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/dental-implants-in-richmond-bc/Smile-Shapers-Dentist-Richmond-BC.html">Prosthodontics Richmond BC</a><br> <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/dental-implants-in-richmond-bc/Smile-Shapers-Dentist-Richmond-BC.html">Prosthodontist Richmond BC</a><br> <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/dental-implants-in-richmond-bc/Smile-Shapers-Dentist-Richmond-BC.html">Teeth Cleaning Richmond BC</a><br> <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/dental-implants-in-richmond-bc/Smile-Shapers-Dentist-Richmond-BC.html">Cosmetic Dentist Richmond BC</a><br> <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/dental-implants-in-richmond-bc/Smile-Shapers-Dentist-Richmond-BC.html">Veneers Richmond BC</a><br> <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/dental-implants-in-richmond-bc/Smile-Shapers-Dentist-Richmond-BC.html">Teeth Whitening Richmond BC</a><br> <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/dental-implants-in-richmond-bc/Smile-Shapers-Dentist-Richmond-BC.html">Periodontist Richmond BC</a><br> <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/dental-implants-in-richmond-bc/Smile-Shapers-Dentist-Richmond-BC.html">Pediatric Orthodontist in Richmond BC</a><br> <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/dental-implants-in-richmond-bc/Smile-Shapers-Dentist-Richmond-BC.html">Orthodontist Richmond BC</a><br> <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/dental-implants-in-richmond-bc/Smile-Shapers-Dentist-Richmond-BC.html">Orthodontics Richmond BC</a><br> <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/dental-implants-in-richmond-bc/Smile-Shapers-Dentist-Richmond-BC.html">Invisalign Richmond BC</a><br> </p><br></body><br></html>
